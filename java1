The U.S. Census Bureau projects population based on the
following assumptions:
 One birth every 7 seconds
 One death every 13 seconds
 One new immigrant every 45 seconds
Write a program to display the population for each of the next five years. Assume the
current population is 312,032,486 and one year has 365 days. Hint: In Java, if two
integers perform division, the result is an integer. The fractional part is truncated. For
example, 5 / 4 is 1 (not 1.25) and 10 / 4 is 2 (not 2.5). To get an accurate result with the
fractional part, one of the values involved in the division must be a number with a
decimal point. For example, 5.0 / 4 is 1.25 and 10 / 4.0 is 2.5.


CODE:

public class Q2 {
public static void main(String[] args) {
double currentPopulation = 312032486;
double birth = 7.0;
double death = 13.0;
double immigration = 45.0;
double birthsPeryear = (60 * 60 * 24 * 365) / birth;
double deathsPeryear = (60 * 60 * 24 * 365) / death;
double immigratePeryear = (60 * 60 * 24 * 365) / immigration;

for (int i = 1; i &lt;= 5; i++) {
currentPopulation += birthsPeryear - deathsPeryear + immigratePeryear;
System.out.printf(&quot;population in year &quot; + i + &quot; = %1.0f\n&quot;,currentPopulation);
}
}
}
